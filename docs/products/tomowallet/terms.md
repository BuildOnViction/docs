### DEFINITIONS 
- “Applicable Law” means the laws of the Republic of Singapore.
-“Company” means Tomochain Pte.Ltd.(UEN:UEN201716924E), a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore and having its registered office at 10 Anson Road, #22-15, International Plaza, Singapore 079903.

- “Cryptocurrency(ies)” means a digital currency, also referred to as a token, in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of the currency and to verify the transfer of the currency and which operates independently of the central bank of a country. Such digital currency is not legal tender issued by any central bank nor does it confer any interest in the ownership of, or debt relating to, any asset or property.
- “Digital Assets” Similar to Cryptocurrencies, Digital Assets are not backed by governments or central banks. They are not protected by government deposit protection schemes. Digital Assets may be extremely volatile. Digital Assets technology is extremely nascent and unproven. Digital Assets software and providers are regularly subject to hacking attempts resulting in loss of funds.
- “You” or “Your” or “Token Holder” means and shall refer to any person or entity (whether incorporated or not) who purchases the TOMO.

### THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES
- Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities. The private key is connected to the Wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Cryptocurrencies to and from that Wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must keep your Wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Cryptocurrencies associated with the Wallet.
- TomoWallet Cannot Assist With Password Retrieval. TomoWallet stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Cryptocurrencies you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.

- Cryptocurrencies Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Cryptocurrencies transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Cryptocurrencies of associated public blockchain. By using TomoWallet, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the TomoChain Networks.
- Transactions. Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your TomoWallet account.
