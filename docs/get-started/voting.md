## Prerequisites

- Have a wallet connected to the Testnet (See [chapter 1](/get-started/wallet))

## Introduction

With a connected wallet, it's not time to try voting for some masternodes.

## How To Vote

You can access our governance dApp, [CaelumoMaster](https://master.testnet.caelumfoundation.com/), to start voting for masternodes.

CaelumMaster natively supports Metamask. You can also access your account page (the vertical three dots on the top right) to fill in your wallet Private Key or MNEMONIC (see image below).

If you use Metamask, you need to connect Metamask to our testnet (please see the "Create a wallet" section) and choose Metamask in the drop-down settings list.

To login, click the `login` button at the top left corner and choose your connection method.

Once configured, you can vote for masternodes by clicking on the `Vote` button.

At least 100 CLMP is required per vote. After clicking submit, your CLMP will be sent to the voting smart contract and locked there.

## Reward
Every epoch (~30 minutes), you will automatically receive rewards for each masternode you voted for.

## How to Unvote

If you do not want to support a masternode you voted for, you can unvote it by clicking the `Unvote` button on the masternode's page and enter the amount of CLMP you want to unvote.

After unvoting, your CLMP is still locked in the smart contract for 48 hours before you are able to withdraw.

## How to Withdraw

For withdrawals after unvoting, you need to wait until your CLMP is unlocked from the smart contract. Then you can click the `withdraw` button in your account page (the vertical three dots on the top right) and choose which withdrawal you want to receive back your CLMP.

Note that you might see multiple withdrawals on your account page if you made multiple unvotes previously.

If you withdraw before the unlock period expires, an error will be raised.
