## Metamask

TomoChain will guide you how to connect MetaMask to TomoChain Testnet. It is an essential step to study an overview of TomoChain features in term of meeting the crypto trading needs on system.

Get started! You first need to install Extension MetaMask on Chrome or Brave browsers. Once you agree to the Metamask Terms of Use and create an account successfully, follow instructions:

**Step 1:** Click to MetaMask logo on the browser to open the Extention -> select `Network` -> select `Custom RPC` as shown below:

**Step 3:** You successfully connect to TomoChain Testnet after 2 steps. Next, you use TOMO to pay a Gas fee to implement Smart Contact. To have some TOMO in the testnet, you can enter your wallet address in Faucet site [https://faucet.testnet.tomochain.com/](https://faucet.testnet.tomochain.com/) to request some TOMO.

So, you accomplish connecting the MetaMask to TomoChain (testnet). From now on, you can make transactions and develop Dapp as well as Smart Contract as you wish.

## MyEtherWallet

**Step 2:** From <a href="https://myetherwallet.com" target="_blank">MyEtherWallet</a> homepage, at top right corner, select TomoChain Testnet
