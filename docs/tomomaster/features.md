Here are the pages and features available on TomoMaster.

## [Home](https://master.testnet.tomochain.com/)
### Network Status
On TomoMaster, this area shows you what the current block is, the block time, how many blocks are in each epoch, and the next checkpoint (end of epoch).


### Candidates List
The candidates list includes everyone who has deposited enough tokens to run a masternode as well as those who resigned running a masternode.
A candidate is required to be one of the top 150 most voted masternode candidates on this list to become a masternode earning rewards.
Voters can use this list to help choose which masternode candidates or candidates they would like to stake their tokens for.

!!! tip
    Voting for the top voted masternode candidate could lower your rewards as the rewards that go to voters per token is inversely proportional to the number of tokens staked for a specific masternode.


### Voting
Voters who want to stake their tokens for a masternode or masternodes in order to earn rewards can vote through TomoMaster.
Simply click ‘Vote’ and you will be taken to a page that allows you to vote through staking your tokens.


### Unvoting
If you do not want to support a masternode you voted for, you can unvote it by clicking the Unvote button on the masternode's page and enter the amount of TOMO you want to unvote.

!!! warning
    After unvoting, your TOMO will be locked in the smart contract for 48 hours before you are able to withdraw.
