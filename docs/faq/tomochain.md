#### What is Tomochain? How it works?
TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. TomoChain relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support near-zero fee, and 2-second transaction confirmation time. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. 

TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into TomoChain's Masternode architecture which will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses.

#### Is there a way to see the raw data that is stored in the blockchain?
Yes, it is. Token Sale information will be available for viewing on ethplorer or etherscan.

#### How can I check out TomoChain infrastructure?
The TomoChain testnet 2.0 is available at [https://medium.com/tomochain/tomochain-public-testnet-2-0-announcement-c7f49e28eefa](https://medium.com/tomochain/tomochain-public-testnet-2-0-announcement-c7f49e28eefa)

#### What is the difference between POA network and Tomo? Where is the advantage?
At the moment, TomoChain uses PoA consensus like POA Network does. However, POA uses code base of Parity, Tomochain uses code base of Ethereum. Secondly, in the end of 2018, Tomochain will move from PoA consensus to PoSV masternodes.
Thirdly, reagrading confirmation time, with Tomochain technology, one block will be created every 2s while a POA network block requires 5s.
Plus, Tomochain testnet 2.0 can handle +2000tx.

---

#### What exactly is the node of Tomochain?
Initially, regarding PoA concensus, nodes can be chosen by the built-in governance D-app but they will need to pass the technical requirements for scaling of the network.

At the second stage, Master-nodes can be chosen by the network in a trust-less way as long as they hold a sufficient amount of stake and pass the proof of credibility protocol in the governance d-app.

#### Why dont you publish all the codes on Github?
Private development is done in GitLab which free and more convenient. The codes for cross-chain transfer protocol, updates to Geth codebases. Plus, only ReplyBlock is privately developed on Gitlab. But these softwares are actually running on the testnet and production (ReplyBlock) already.

Tomochain products, such as Tomo Governance DApp, Block Explorer publish the source code on: https://github.com/tomochain. We released ICO smart-contract codes, container codes for building node and joint testnet, slides for tomochain roadmap, cross chain transfer demo codes. It should be clear that we are having private repos, and publish codes publicly when they are ready for public, or need to be audited.

We chose the model our team are comfortable with. Publishing work-in-progress is not suitable for us atm for multiple reasons including inviting unnecessary distractions, designing needs a to be done before coding. Protecting and auditing important codes are also more responsible, until the team reaches a certain scale.

We are also working with some third parties who we signed NDA (non disclosure agreement) for the codes developed.

---

#### Is Tomochain a side chain of Ethereum?
No, it isn't. Tomochain has its own blockchain.

---

#### What is the difference between Tomocoin and Tomochain?

Tomocoin (TOMO) is token. Tomochain is an infrustructure.

#### How to become a Tomochain masternode?
You need to deposit 50k TOMO to become a masternode candidate. Candidates become Masternodes if they belong to the top 150 most voted. 
 
---

#### What are Candidate/ Masternode incentives?

Masternodes will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which likely exceeds the cost for running the infrastructure. However, Masternodes need to invest in TomoChain by depositing  at least 50K Tomo, and stake them for a long term. Furthermore, after depositing 50K Tomo to become a Candidate, if the account cannot become a Masternode (has less votes than Top  150 most voted  Candidates), he/she will receive no rewards. Therefore, Candidates have an incentive to do as much as they can such as signaling their capability to support TomoChain to get into top 150 most voted Candidates.

---

#### What are Token Voter incentives? Do voters get reward from node holders too?

Token voters should vote for Candidates who signal a strong support for TomoChain because if the Candidate does not become a Masternode, voters will not receive any rewards. However, token voters should also vote for the less voted Candidates because the most voted Candidates will receive less reward per token stake comparatively. 

---

#### How will reward be divided? 

The reward achieved by each Masternode  will be divided into three portions. The first portion of 40% called “Infrastructure Reward” goes to the Masternode. The second portion of 50% called “Staking Reward” goes to the pool of all voters  for that  Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token  stake. The last portion of 10% called “Foundation Reward” goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by TomoChain company initially.
